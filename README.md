# Py-little-programs: a collection of little programs written in Python

This repository contains a collection of little programs written in Python for academic purposes. The programs are organized in folders, each one containing a README.md file with a brief description of the program and the source code.

## How to run the programs

To run the programs you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have installed Python 3, you can run the programs from the command line. For example, to run the program `inventory-control` you need to open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the program and type:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
